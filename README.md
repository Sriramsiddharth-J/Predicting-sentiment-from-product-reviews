# Predicting-sentiment-from-product-reviews

The goal was to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with existing Turi Create functions.
In this notebook I have used product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.

1. Used SFrames to do some feature engineering

2. Trained a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.

3. Inspected the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.

4. Made a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.

5. Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, wrote a function to compute the accuracy of the model.

6. Inspected the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpreted their meanings.

7. Compared multiple logistic regression models.
